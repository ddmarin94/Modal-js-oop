## Simple Modal Exercise
This is a simple exercise to practice in **OOP** with **javascript**.

To test this repo in your computer do git clone of it and just open the index.html in your current browser.

You will find in JS just a class that will be initialized when the load listener in window object will be execute.

Then the code will be available and the program will work.

Enjoy it :)
